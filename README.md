# Famous Birthday Problem and Monty Hall Problem

This repository contains code for two famous probability problems: the Famous Birthday Problem and the Monty Hall Problem. These files aim to provide code implementations of these problems to enhance understanding and experimental exploration.

## Famous Birthday Problem

The [Famous Birthday Problem](famous_birthday_problem.py) file contains code that demonstrates the probability problem known as the Famous Birthday Problem. It explores the question of how many people are needed in a group to have a certain probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday. The code calculates the probability for various group sizes and provides a clear example of the phenomenon.

## Monty Hall Problem

The [Monty Hall Problem](monty_hall_problem.py) file contains code that tackles the famous Monty Hall Problem. This problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where a contestant chooses one of three doors, one of which hides a valuable prize. After the initial choice, the host, Monty Hall, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a non-prize door. The contestant is then given the opportunity to switch their initial choice. The code in this file simulates the Monty Hall Problem and compares the probabilities of winning when switching or sticking with the initial choice.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the respective file for the problem you wish to explore (`famous_birthday_problem.py` or `monty_hall_problem.py`).

3. Run the code using a Python interpreter or integrated development environment (IDE).

4. The code will output the results, providing insights into the probability scenarios for the specific problem.
